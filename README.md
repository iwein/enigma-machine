Unraveling the enigma machine
---------------

This is a solution to a workshop given by ugly Ducklings James Dobson. I've created it to show off at Xebia together with James. 

You can read this code and see a few lines of Scala, but you'll probably have more fun if you try the workshop for yourself. Maybe we'll make a video of it some day.
