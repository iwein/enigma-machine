We went crazy with JUnit's parameterized testrunner.

STUFF-WE-DIDN'T-GET-AROUND-TO's:
* Implement the reflector.
* Implement the complete transformation.
* Make for configurable notches (currently assumes 'Z'), updating the rotor 
  tests accordingly will be somewhat interesting.
* Make the acceptance test use the correct initial positions, rather 
  than (A,A,A).
* Improve naming of various bits, particularly the rotor/-reflected stuff.
